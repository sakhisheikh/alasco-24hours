## ðŸŽ“ Initial Approach

The all three problems were quite interesting and held me for a while for optimal solutions.

These are following approaches for gives tasks: 

- **Rectangle intersect.** The problem was a bit easier than other two. We just need to check two conditions where rectangles don't overlap. 

- First rectangle is on above top edge of the second rectangle.
-  Second rectangle is on right side of right edge of first rectangle.

`To keep rectangle adjascent coordinates in right order`, I added labels with x,y postions to avoid confusions.

- **Dices** This is one of the most interesting problems of Probability I have ever seen. Definitely I didn't get the optimal solution on first try. I was a bit confused initially by looking at the `payback` column and pondered about its context. By reading it for several times, I got a redirection to start it with a loop to get random probabilities but loops always come with a cost. Since the most exciting thing about this question was it has probability part. So I skipped loop part and went straight to calculate probabilities dynamically. All things like `sides, possibleCombinations and SumProbabilities` were dynamically calculted. Hence it was a much faster solution which I felt much satisfied myself in the end by using probabilistic apporoach and just mulitply with number of iterations in the end even id there are *Trillion* iterations.

- **Currency Concerter**. Everything I love about react is it's power to code much more neater, blazingly fast if we do it properly. I chose `https://apilayer.com/` for exchange rates. Material-UI has always been my first choice since it's elegance approach to write modular css without blocking the main thread and immense ways to css overriding. I touched a bit of `react-spring` as well for currency conversion animation. I always love to put loaders in redux so easy to plug them from anywhere in the app. All code is completey linted and prettifies and UNIT TESTING is done for two components. I tried a to write some basic 3-5 unit tests. I have included git pre-commit hooks just to make sure there would not buggy and bad formatted code be pushed. 

## ðŸš€ Motivation

All things in these challenges I see only much way forward to refine myself on daily basis. I really enjoy while developing react apps and even any programming is Jacascript. I love JS community and respect everyone since I need to contribute more than the previous day.
